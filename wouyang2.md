### I want to focus on Application Development expecially on IOS platform. 
I studied Machine learning and used it to develop a Phishing website detection app and implement it on an Andriod platform last semester, 
so for this class project, I want to step into Game Development and implement it on IOS platform. Tools I might be using in the project will be swift, python, any kinds of library
