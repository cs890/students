I am a first year PhD student. My research area is machine learning and its application in power systems. 
In the class, Professor Mockus suggested that I could do project or paper review on software engineering and power systems.
However, the project and paper review will be done with other group members. I am not sure if I can find people who are interested in power systems.
If there is someone, that will be great. If not, I am also open to topics on software and machine learning.
