My name is Tommy Smith, I am a first-year master's student taking this as a required class. I am interested in software app and web development. I am interested in Text and image Analysis as well as bio-inspired/GenAI tools. I would be interested in analyzing or creating different tools to aid in software or web development techniques. Maybe something like Pytorch vs Tensorflow, different approaches to image/text recognition, a tool for training data, etc.
